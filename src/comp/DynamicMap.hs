-- This is a map which tracks changing values.
-- It associates keys with different values at different times
-- and supports looking up the value most-recently associated
-- with a key at any point in time.  It also allows the time
-- resolution before a particular point to be discarded to save
-- space when it is no longer required.

-- Map from each key to a map from times to the value of the key
-- at that time.

-- The value of each key at the split time is recorded in the second

-- at and beyond the given time but to throw away information
-- on the changes which led up to that value.
