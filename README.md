# BESSPIN-BSC #

**IMPORTANT:** This is a fork of an old version of the [Bluespec Compiler (BSC)](https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc) for the BESSPIN project.  It is years out of date at this point (predating the BSC public open source release).  **USE THE REAL [BSC REPOSITORY](https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc) IF YOU WISH TO USE/DEVELOP/EXTEND BSC.**
