To build a release, log into "earth" and run:

  $ make -f Makefile.release VERSION=yyyy.mm.tag

To build a release containing only 64-bit binaries and libraries, run:

  $ make -f Makefile.release VERSION=yyyy.mm.tag release-64only

Other options are available, as explained in comments in the Makefile.

After building a release, delete the work directories by running:

  $ make -f Makefile.release VERSION=yyyy.mm.tag clean

The Makefile relies on permanent Debian sarge chroots in the following
directories on "earth":

  /home/2013-sarge/{32,64}/

If there is a problem, you can consult the logs and the work directories.
Details are in the comments further down in the Makefile.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above directions are for building a release containing binaries and
libraries for multiple environments, specifically chosen for compatibility.

If you are building in a different environment and would like to simply
package up those files into a release format.  That can be done by running:

  $ make -f Makefile.native VERSION=yyyy.mm.tag BSCSRC=<path-to-bsc-repo>

This will produce a tarball that does not include the documentation.
If you with to include the documentation, then you will need to point make
to the location of a bsc-doc repo, as follows:

  $ make -f Makefile.native VERSION=yyyy.mm.tag \
        BSCSRC=<path-to-bsc-repo> \
	DOCSRC=<path-to-bsc-doc-repo>

As with the official release process, you will need to clean the files after:

  $ make -f Makefile.native VERSION=yyyy.mm.tag clean

Other options are also available.  See comments in the Makefile.
