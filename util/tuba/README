Tuba is a visual Tcl debugger, requiring Tcl/Tk 8.0 to run. Tuba should
work on any Tcl-supported platform, but it has only been tested on Linux,
SunOS, and Windows 95. As of release 2.5.b1, Tuba now supports debugging
[incr tcl] scripts.

Please find more extensive documentation in the doc directory:

doc/index.html  - an overview and introduction to the Tuba debugger. Currently,
                  this also serves as the web page for Tuba.
doc/USERS.html  - detailed users guide.


INSTALLATION
============

Tuba has a simple installation. Unpack the tuba tar or zip file somewhere. Ta
da! It's installed! Actually, there can be more:

  1) By default, you get the Tcl-based parser. If you want a faster parser,
     you can install one of the prebuilt shared libraries. Get the proper 
     shared library from the distribution site and unpack it in the same 
     directory as Tuba:
     
          tar xzvf tuba-2.5.b1-Linux.tar.gz

     When you start Tuba the next time, it will detect the shared library 
     and use it. Prebuilts are currently available for Linux and SunOS.
     
     If you have a system other than these, you can build your own shared
     library. Go into the src directory and start with the README file there.
     
  2) On Unix systems, you can set the first line in the tuba to point to
     your wish8.0 executable. The default may not be correct for your 
     environment.

  3) On Unix systems, you may want to create a symbolic link to the tuba
     program to somewhere in your path:
     
       ln -s $PWD/tuba somewhere/bin/tuba


If you would like to build or rebuild the shared libraries, go into the
src directory and start with the README file there.
