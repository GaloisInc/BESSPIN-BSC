Saint:: Stand Alone Instrumenter</H1>
This is the design documentation for the <U>saint</U> or Stand Alone Instrumenter
package for Tuba and other Tcl tools.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Background</H2>
In Tuba, the instrumenter is tightly integrated in the debugger code. This
makes a tool like testinstrumenter very difficult. And any other non-Tuba
use of the instrumenter (such as Tea) is next to impossible.
<H2>
Goals</H2>
I want to decouple the instrumenter from the debugger so that it can be
used as a general code instrumenter. Tools that can use this could be a
proc lister, line-of-code counter, a profiler, code documentors, etc.

<P>Another advantage to this decoupling is to be able to swap in different
parsers for Tuba.
<H2>
Interfaces</H2>
In order for the instrumenter to have some smarts, there needs to be a
two-way communication between the instrumenter and the client. This interface
will be in terms of procs (a Tea class version will be available later).
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Instrumenter Interface</H3>
All procs of the instrumenter should be defined in a namespace called <TT>instrumenter</TT>.
This namespace should be relative so that the client can stick it anywhere
it wants.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Namespace</H4>
All instrumenting implementations must adhere to the following interface.
This allows the client to talk to the instrumenter in an abstract fashion.

<P>The namespace definition should look something like this:
<UL>
<PRE>namespace eval instrumenter {
&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
}</PRE>
</UL>

<H4>
The procs</H4>
The following procs must be defined by the instrumenter. Clients should
not assume that these will be exported.
<H5>
instrumenter::init {libdir clientns options}</H5>

<UL>This initializes the instrumenter.

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>libdir</TT>
<UL>The full path pointing to the lib directory where the instrumenter
source came from. Useful for loading auxliary files.</UL>
<TT>clientns</TT>
<UL>The namespace where the client callback procs are defined. The callback
procs are discussed in the <A HREF="#Client Interface">Client Interface</A>.</UL>
<TT>options</TT>
<UL>Options for the instrumenter in <TT>array get</TT> format. These can
be dependent on the instrumenter. The following are standard across all
instrumenters:</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>parser</B>. Possible values:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
T use Tcl code</LI>

<LI>
C use C/C++ version of code, if available.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
<B>cachedir</B>. Sets the directory of where cached files are stored and
read from. If empty, then do no caching.</LI>

<LI>
Instrumentation Actions. A fine degree of control of the instrumentation
can be achieved with the action options. These consist of a two-digit number.
The first digit designates the action to perform on the toplevel command.
The second digit is the action to perform on any embedded code bodies,
such that is found in commands like if, proc, while, etc. Another possible
value for the action is a question mark, which means ask the client via
a callback for the action to take.</LI>


<P>Each digit can have the following values, with their meanings associated
with it:
<BR>&nbsp;

</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>Nothing.</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
instrumenter::instrument {file}</H5>

<UL>This instruments a file. Can be called many times.

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>file</TT>
<UL>The file to instrument.</UL>
</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>Return the instrumented code contained in <TT>file</TT>.</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
instrumenter::purgeCache {}</H5>

<UL>Purges the cache directory of all files.

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL>None
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>None</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
instrumenter::getLevel {}</H5>

<UL>This is for retrieving the current block level. The instrumenter needs
to keep track of what level it is parsing. The value is maintained only
at load time, <B>not</B> run time.

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL>None</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>An integer value of the current block level. 0 signifies the top level.</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="Client Interface"></A>Client Interface</H3>
The client must also provide an interface for the instrumenter. There are
two types of callbacks the instrumenter will make back to the client: those
at instrument time, and those at runtime.
<H4>
Namespace</H4>
The client tells the instrumented the namespace to use for the callbacks
when he calls the <TT>instrumenter::init</TT> proc; therefore, there is
no special namespace requirements for the client.
<H4>
Instrument-time procs</H4>
Instrument time callbacks are mostly for statistics to inform the client
when various Tcl entities crop up, like procs or statements.
<H5>
foundCommand{file line commandvar}</H5>

<UL>Called for every command found during instrumentation. This callback
is only called if the <B>commandaction</B> initialization variable is set
to ? (ask).

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>file</TT>
<UL>Name of the source file the command was found in.</UL>
<TT>line</TT>
<UL>Beginning line number of the command.</UL>
<TT>commandvar</TT>
<UL>The name of the variable containing the command. To read and possibly
modify the command, you must use <TT>upvar</TT>.</UL>

<UL>&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>The command value in commandvar can be modified. This allows the client
to do some extra processing on the command.

<P>The following return codes have meaning to the instrumenter:

<P>0 - ignore the command
<BR>1 - put the command into the instrumented buffer, but don't instrument
it
<BR>2 - put the command into the instrumented buffer, and instrument it</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
foundComment {file begline commentvar}</H5>

<UL>Called for every comment found. For this to be called, the initializer
variable <B>commentaction</B> must be set to ? (ask).

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>file</TT>
<UL>Name of the source file the comment was found in.</UL>
<TT>begline</TT>
<UL>Beginning line number of the comment.</UL>
<TT>commentvar</TT>
<UL>Name of the variable containing the text of the comment, including
the # character. The client needs to use <TT>upvar</TT> to access this,
and the client can modify the comment text.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>The following return codes have meaning to the instrumenter:

<P>0 - ignore the comment
<BR>1 - put the comment into the instrumented buffer</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
&nbsp;foundProc {file line commandvar procnamevar dynamicflag}</H5>

<UL>Called for every proc found. This callback is only called if the initialization
variable procaction is set to ? (ask).

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>file</TT>
<UL>Name of the source file the proc was defined in.</UL>
<TT>line</TT>
<UL>Line number proc begins on.</UL>
commandvar
<UL>The name of the variable containing the proc command. This is so the
client can change the proc command to something else. Client needs to use
upvar to access variable.</UL>
<TT>procnamevar</TT>
<UL>Name of the variable holding the name of the proc. The client can modify
the procname. Client needs to use upvar to access variable.</UL>
<TT>dynamicflag</TT>
<UL>This flag is true (1) if the proc has been deemed a dynamic proc; false
(0) otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>The command value in commandvar can be modified. This allows the client
to do some extra processing on the command. The proc name can be modified
in the same manner.

<P>The following return codes have meaning to the instrumenter:

<P>0 - ignore the proc definition
<BR>1 - put the proc into the instrumented buffer, but don't instrument
it
<BR>2 - put the proc into the instrumented buffer, and instrument it
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>

<H4>
Run-time procs</H4>
Runtime callbacks are invoked if the instrumented code is ever run.
<H5>
statement {file line stmt}</H5>

<UL>This is the main callback the instrumentation inserts. Each statement
in the file is wrapped with this callback.

<P>Inputs
<UL>file
<UL>The name of the source file this statement lives in.</UL>
line
<UL>Line number of the statement.</UL>
stmt
<UL>The original statement. Statement may contain nested instrumentation
if it is a composite statement like if or while.</UL>
</UL>
Outputs
<UL>This should return whatever the statement returns, both error codes
and return text.</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
procEntry {procname}</H5>

<UL>Called at the beginning of each proc. This callback is only called
when the initialization variable <B>procentryaction</B> is set to 1.

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>procname</TT>
<UL>The name of the procedure just entered. <I>Should this be fully qualified
with namespace?</I></UL>
</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>Nothing</UL>
</UL>

<H5>
procExit {procname}</H5>

<UL>Called when a proc exits. This callback is only called when the initialization
variable <B>procexitaction</B> is set to 1.

<P><U>Inputs</U>
<UL><TT>procname</TT>
<UL>The name of the procedure just exited. <I>Should this be fully qualified
with namespace?</I></UL>
&nbsp;</UL>
<U>Outputs</U>
<UL>Nothing
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>
